==================================== Section 1.2 =========================================
1.2.1 What are hardware and software?
=== ANSWER ===
Hardware: physical parts that computer is build from such as: Case, CPU, Memory (RAM, HDD)
I/O devices.

Software: is a program written in some program language which coordinate i.e. control
the operation of an hardware component.

From text: Hardware visible, physical elements of the computer.
Software provides the invisible instructions that control the hardware and make it perform
specific tasks.


1.2.2 List the five major hardware components of a computer.
=== ANSWER ===
1. CPU - core which consists of 2 main units: Control unit and Arithmetic/Logic unit
2. Memory - is the working area of the CPU. Date stored and retrieved from this component.
            RAM is volatile memory i.e. turning off the machine will result losing all
            data stored in RAM memory.
            Fast operations.
            Small capacity.
3. Storage - permanently store data to read it later. Solved RAM volatile effect.
             Slow memory compared to RAM.
             Much bigger capacity then RAM.
4. I/O - Keyboard and mouse are main input devices to computer.
         Monitor and printer are main output devices.
5. Communication - Modem are used to connect to other computer within a network.


1.2.3 What does the acronym CPU stand for?
      What unit is used to measure CPU speed?
=== ANSWER ===
CPU stands for Central Processing Unit.
CPU speed is measured by core-clock which work in constant rate and it synchronizes the CPU
work i.e. for each core-clock pulse one-instruction is executed by the CPU.
Core-clock measurement speed is HZ unit. 1Hz is 1 pulse per second.
My CPU Core-Clock is 4.2GHz i.e. my CPU can execute 4200 million instructions per-second. ðŸ’¥


1.2.4 What is a bit? What is a byte?
=== ANSWER ===
PC hardware can have only 2 states On/Off.
States are represented by a bit which is 1 for On and 0 for Off.
To represent a meaningful data such as number or character bit is not enough.
Byte is used to represent such meaningful data.
Byte is an ordered sequence of 8 bits.
E.g. the number 4 can be represented as one byte as follows: 00000100
My name "Alex" can be represented using 4 bytes: 01000001 01101100 01100101 01111000


1.2.5 What is memory for?
      What does RAM stand for?
      Why is memory called RAM?
=== ANSWER ===
Memory is the working area of the computer.
To be able to do work CPU's control unit uses the memory (RAM) to retrieve/store data
from/to the memory.
RAM - Random Access Memory.
RAM is a sequence of ordered bytes.
Each byte has a unique address, thus CPU can access any random byte using its memory
address this is why RAM called random access.


1.2.6 What unit is used to measure memory size?
      What unit is used to measure disk size?
=== ANSWER ===
Memory size measured using number of bytes.
RAM nowadays is measured in GBytes i.e. billion bytes.
I have 8GB i.e. the working area is 8 billion ordered bytes.
Disk size is measured also with bytes but way less then memory size.
CD-R/W is 700MB i.e. 700 million bytes.


1.2.7 What is the primary difference between memory and a storage device?
=== ANSWER ===
RAM Memory is much faster in operation because it is "close" to the CPU thus it must be fast
enough to work along with the CPU Core-Clock (its not working at the speed).
Less memory capacity.
Expensive.
Volatile.

Storage: Slow, not-volatile i.e. permanent store of data, Bigger capacity, Cheap.
