==================================== Section 1.8 =========================================
1.8.1 What is the Java source filename extension, and what is the Java bytecode filename
extension?
=== ANS ===
Source file   => .java
Bytecode file => .class


1.8.2 What are the input and output of a Java compiler?
=== ANS ===
Source Code => compiler => Bytecode file


1.8.3 What is the command to compile a Java program?
=== ANS ===
javac MyClass.java


1.8.4 What is the command to run a Java program?
=== ANS ===
java MyClass


1.8.5 What is the JVM?
=== ANS ===
After source file has been successfully compiled and bytecode file generated, this
bytecode contains machine instruction to execute our source code.
JVM is virtual machine that interprets bytecode file and executes every single line
along with other library code.
It translates the individual instructions in the bytecode into the target machine
language code one at a time, rather than the whole program as a single unit.


1.8.6 Can Java run on any machine?
      What is needed to run Java on a computer?
=== ANS ===
Java is platform independent i.e. as long as there is a JVM installed on the machine
Java program can be run on this machine because essentially Java uses JVM which interprets
java bytecode to machine code.
All what is needed to run Java program is JVM.


1.8.7 If a NoClassDefFoundError occurs when you run a program, what is the cause of the error?
=== ANS ===
We try to execute bytecode file that does not exist.
E.g. javac MyClass.java => MyClass.class is generated
     java myClass => NoClassDefFoundError


1.8.8 If a NoSuchMethodError occurs when you run a program, what is the cause of the error?
=== ANS ===
We try to execute (java MyClass) class file that does not have main method.
Error: Main method not found in class MyClass, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
