1.4.3 What are multiprogramming, multithreading, and multiprocessing?
=== ANSWER ===
Multiprogramming: most of the time CPU is idle because it is much faster then all the other
hardware components. To utilize its speed we can run multiple programs simultaneously using
the same CPU.

Multithreading: we can execute multiple tasks at the same time. e.g. watching Youtube video
while writing code in text editor with auto save enabled.

Multiprocessing: running multiple programs concurrently using multiple processors.

Multiprogramming allows multiple programs to run simultaneously by sharing the CPU.
Multithreading allows concurrency within a program, so that its subtasks can run at the same time.
Multiprocessing, or parallel processing, uses two or more processors together to perform a task.
