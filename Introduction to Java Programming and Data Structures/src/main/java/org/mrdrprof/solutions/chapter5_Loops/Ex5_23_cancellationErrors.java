/**
 * *5.23 (Demonstrate cancellation errors) A cancellation error occurs when you are
 * manipulating a very large number with a very small number. The large number
 * may cancel out the smaller number.
 * For example, the result of 100000000.0 + 0.000000001 is equal to 100000000.0.
 * To avoid cancellation errors and obtain more accurate results,
 * carefully select the order of computation.
 * For example, in computing the following summation, you will obtain more
 * accurate results by computing from right to left rather than from left
 * to right
 * 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n
 * <p>
 * Write a program that compares the results of the summation of the preceding
 * series, computing from left to right and from right to left with n = 50000.
