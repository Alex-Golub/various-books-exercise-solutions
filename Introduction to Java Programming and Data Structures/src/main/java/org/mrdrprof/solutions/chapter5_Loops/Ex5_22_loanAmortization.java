/**
 * **5.22 (Financial application: loan amortization schedule)
 * The monthly payment for a given loan pays the principal and the interest.
 * The monthly interest is computed by multiplying the monthly interest rate
 * and the balance (the remaining principal).
 * The principal paid for the month is therefore the monthly payment minus
 * the monthly interest.
 * Write a program that lets the user enter the loan amount,
 * number of years, and interest rate then displays the amortization
 * schedule for the loan.
