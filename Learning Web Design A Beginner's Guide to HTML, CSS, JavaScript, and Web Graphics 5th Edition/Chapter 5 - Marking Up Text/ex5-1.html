    <h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>

    <p>
      This is a really simple dish to prepare and it’s always a big hit at
      parties. My father recommends:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just
        bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try
        serving it warm."
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

        as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are <br />
        incorporated, but still retain some <br />
        texture.
