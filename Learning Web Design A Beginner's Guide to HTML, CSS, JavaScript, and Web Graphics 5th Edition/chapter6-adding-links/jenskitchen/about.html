    <h1>About Jen&rsquo;s Kitchen</h1>

    <p>
      The recipes listed here are ones that I have developed myself. In some
      cases, I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or magazine, but over
      time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own. <i>Bon Appetit!</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources. One
      day, I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews.
