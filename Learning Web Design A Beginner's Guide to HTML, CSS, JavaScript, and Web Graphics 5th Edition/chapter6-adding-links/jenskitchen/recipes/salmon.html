    <h1>Garlic Salmon</h1>

    <p>
      This is one of my favorite recipes for when folks come over for dinner.
      I've already shared this popular recipe with many of my friends. The best
      thing is it's <em>so easy</em> to make!
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>1/4 c. dry sherry</li>
      <li>2 T. soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 T. vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 t. dry mustard</li>
      <li>3-4 T. freshly minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 to 2 lbs salmon filets</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix together first 5 ingredients in a shallow dish. Place the cleaned
        and de-boned salmon filets face down in the mixture and allow to
        marinate for 1/2 to 1 hour. (Tip, I cut a large piece of salmon into the
        serving sizes before marinating so the marinade can coat the sides of
        each piece as well.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the broiler. Transfer filets to a baking sheet, skin-down. Broil
        the salmon on the top rack for 7 to 9 minutes, or until done to your
        liking (I like it still pink in the center).
      </li>
      <li>
        I usually serve this with an aromatic rice and a lightly seasoned stir
        fry.
      </li>
    </ol>
