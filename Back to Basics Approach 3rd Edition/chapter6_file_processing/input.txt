We're no strangers to love, You know the rules and so do I,
A full commitment's what Im thinking of, You wouldn't get
this from any other guy. I just wanna tell you how I'm
feeling, Gotta make you understand. Never gonna give you up,
Never gonna let you down, Never gonna run around and desert
you. Never gonna make you cry, Never gonna say goodbye,
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
